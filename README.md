# Pixecho | Display Images in Any Terminal
### Go to the [demo link](https://pixecho.vercel.app), upload an image and then adjust settings, and then use the copy button to copy the command to your clipboard and the download button to download it as a file. You can also compare the edited and non-edited photos. Then run it on your terminal and see the magic!
